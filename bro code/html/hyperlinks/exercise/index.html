        Why do I have to stay here on the ground it's overrated
        The city scape escapes you with a sound
        It's delineated
        I waited at the station for an hour
        But I won't make it
        You take off on an updraft by the tower
        And you over take it

        Every moon that I
        See you on the rise
        You're drawn across the sky
        Now that ink has dried
        And I can't tell you why
        Oh, Mimi can you
        Tell me there's an issue
        I've seen it clouded all around you
        I hear you tell me there's an issue
        You've seen before
        Oh, Mimi can you
        Tell me there's an issue
        I've seen it clouded it all around you
        I hear you tell me there's an issue
        You've seen before  
        I can't tell you why
        No I can't tell you why

        Why do you have to stay here on the ground it's overrated
        The city scape berates you with a sound
        It's delineated
        And no one here has even learned your name
        But they all claim it
        They saw you land and ran to do the same
        But they won't make it

        Every moon that I
        See you on the rise
        You're drawn across the sky
        Now that ink has dried
        And I can't tell you why
        Oh, Mimi can you
        Tell me there's an issue
        I've seen it clouded all around you
        I hear you tell me there's an issue
        You've seen before
        Oh, Mimi can you
        Tell me there's an issue
        I've seen it clouded it all around you
        I hear you tell me there's an issue
        You've seen before
        And I can't tell you why
        And I can't tell you why
        And I can't tell you why
        I can't tell you why

        Tell me there's an issue
        I've seen it clouded all around you
        I hear you tell me there's an issue
        You've seen before
        Oh, Mimi can you
        Tell me there's an issue
        I've seen it clouded it all around you
        I hear you tell me there's an issue you've seen before
        And I can't tell you why
        I can't tell you why
